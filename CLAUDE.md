# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## What This Repo Does

Ansible role (`dcm_deploy`) that deploys DCM (Data Center Management) as podman quadlet containers managed by systemd on RHEL 9 / Fedora. Part of the [dcm-project](https://github.com/dcm-project) org — this is the canonical production deployment path for running DCM on a RHEL 9 host without Kubernetes.

## Dependencies

Requires the `ansible.posix` collection (for `firewalld` module):
```bash
ansible-galaxy collection install ansible.posix
```

## Commands

```bash
# Core-only deployment (defaults are sufficient, no vars file needed)
ansible-playbook -i inventory/hosts main.yml

# Deployment with custom vars
ansible-playbook -i inventory/hosts --extra-vars "vars_path=vars/dcm.yml" main.yml

# Run a single deployment phase
ansible-playbook -i inventory/hosts --extra-vars "role_name=dcm_deploy" --extra-vars "task_name=validate_deployment" run_role_task.yml

# Check quadlet templates match upstream compose.yaml (runs locally, no inventory needed)
ansible-playbook verify_compose_alignment.yml

# Run Molecule template rendering tests (no inventory needed)
molecule test

# Run a single deployment phase using tags
ansible-playbook -i inventory/hosts --tags deploy_quadlet_files main.yml
```

## Inventory

Inventory needs a host with root SSH access. Example (`inventory/hosts`):
```ini
[dcm]
myhost ansible_host=10.0.0.1 ansible_user=root
```

For hosts behind a jump box, add `ansible_ssh_common_args='-o ProxyJump=root@jumphost'`.

## Deploying Providers

Core services deploy with defaults — no vars file required. To enable optional providers, create a vars file:

**KubeVirt and K8s Container** only need a kubeconfig:
```yaml
dcm_provider_kubevirt: true
dcm_kubevirt_kubeconfig: "/path/to/kubeconfig"

dcm_provider_k8s_container: true
dcm_k8s_container_sp_kubeconfig: "/path/to/kubeconfig"
```

**Three-tier demo** requires `dcm_provider_k8s_container` to also be enabled — it shares the k8s-container kubeconfig:
```yaml
dcm_provider_k8s_container: true
dcm_k8s_container_sp_kubeconfig: "/path/to/kubeconfig"
dcm_provider_three_tier_demo: true
```

**ACM Cluster** requires additional fields (all mandatory, validated before deploy):
```yaml
dcm_provider_acm_cluster: true
dcm_acm_cluster_sp_kubeconfig: "/path/to/kubeconfig"
dcm_acm_cluster_sp_base_domain: "example.com"
dcm_acm_cluster_sp_pull_secret: '{{ lookup("env", "REDHAT_PULL_SECRET") | b64encode }}'
dcm_acm_cluster_sp_default_infra_env: "default"
dcm_acm_cluster_sp_agent_namespace: "assisted-installer"
```

The `pull_secret` must be a valid `.dockerconfigjson` JSON string, base64-encoded. Use `| b64encode` in the same Jinja2 expression as the lookup — if done separately (e.g., in the template), Ansible auto-parses the JSON into a Python dict first, producing single-quoted keys that break the container. Each provider uses a different kubeconfig env var internally — don't assume they're interchangeable in templates.

## Architecture

**Playbook entry points:** `main.yml` runs the full role. `run_role.yml`, `run_role_task.yml`, and `run_task.yml` are helpers for running individual roles or task phases. All four load variables from `vault_path`/`vault_dir` and `vars_path`/`vars_dir` extra-vars before executing.

**The role** (`roles/dcm_deploy/`) deploys 12 containers in six sequential phases defined in `tasks/main.yml`: prerequisites → generate_configs → deploy_quadlet_files → initialize_database → start_services → validate_deployment. An optional `resolve_rootless_vars` phase runs first (when `dcm_rootless: true`) to set internal facts that adapt all paths, ownership, and systemd scope for rootless Podman deployment.

**Config source of truth:** Traefik config and PostgreSQL init SQL are NOT templated — they're copied from a clone of the upstream [api-gateway](https://github.com/dcm-project/api-gateway) repo at deploy time. Only `dcm.env.j2` and the quadlet unit files are Jinja2 templates.

## Critical Naming Convention

There is a deliberate split between container names and systemd unit names:

- **Quadlet filenames** use `dcm-` prefix: `dcm-postgres.container` → generates `dcm-postgres.service`
- **Container names** match compose exactly (NO prefix): `ContainerName=postgres`
- **Systemd dependencies** use `dcm-` unit names: `After=dcm-postgres.service`
- **Environment variables** use compose hostnames: `DB_HOST=postgres`
- **Network quadlet** `dcm-network.network` generates `dcm-network-network.service` (note the double `-network`)

Exception: `dcm-ui` keeps the `dcm-` prefix as its container name (`ContainerName=dcm-ui`) to avoid conflicts with any other `ui` container.

Mixing these up breaks either systemd dependency ordering or container DNS resolution.

## Modifying Templates

All quadlet templates are in `roles/dcm_deploy/templates/`. When editing:

- Every container must have `dcm-network-network.service` in both `After=` and `Requires=`
- Manager images use `Pull=always` (important for `main` tags that update)
- Volume mounts need SELinux suffixes: `:Z` for private (data volumes), `:z` for shared (read-only configs)
- Environment variables shared across managers go in `dcm.env.j2`; per-service vars go as `Environment=` directives in the container template
- Cross-reference env vars against upstream `compose.yaml` — the compose file is the source of truth

## Provider Templates

Optional providers (kubevirt, k8s-container, acm-cluster, three-tier-demo) are gated by `dcm_provider_*` boolean vars. Each provider's required vars are validated before templating — kubevirt/k8s-container only need a kubeconfig, but ACM needs five additional fields (see "Deploying Providers" above). The kubeconfig env var name differs per provider (`KUBERNETES_KUBECONFIG`, `SP_K8S_KUBECONFIG`, `KUBECONFIG`) — don't copy-paste between templates.

The three-tier-demo provider requires `dcm_provider_k8s_container` to be enabled; it shares the `dcm_k8s_container_sp_kubeconfig` path.

## Rootless Support

When `dcm_rootless: true`, the `resolve_rootless_vars` phase sets internal facts that the rest of the role consumes transparently:

- `_dcm_systemd_scope` — `user` (vs `system`)
- `_dcm_wanted_by` — `default.target` (vs `multi-user.target`)
- `_dcm_file_owner` / `_dcm_file_group` — the rootless user/group
- `_dcm_become_user` — the user to `become` for systemd and podman operations
- `_dcm_rootless_env` — environment dict with `XDG_RUNTIME_DIR` for user-scoped dbus

The `dcm_quadlet_dir` and `dcm_config_dir` variables are overridden via `set_fact` to point at user-scoped paths. Existing template and task references work unchanged because they use these variable names.

Rootless and rootful are mutually exclusive on the same host. There is no migration path between them — data volumes are stored in different Podman storage locations.

## Syncing with Upstream api-gateway

The upstream compose.yaml at `https://github.com/dcm-project/api-gateway` is the source of truth. When it changes, this role must be updated to match. Run `ansible-playbook verify_compose_alignment.yml` first — it checks template file existence, environment variable coverage, dependency ordering (`depends_on` vs `After=`/`Requires=`), port mappings, and image name alignment. If it passes, the templates are in sync with compose.

### New service added to compose.yaml

First classify it: **core manager** (needs DB, always deployed) or **optional provider** (behind a feature flag, needs kubeconfig). If unclear, check the `dcm-project` GitHub org — a service image `quay.io/dcm-project/<name>` typically has its source at `https://github.com/dcm-project/<name>`. Read the repo's README and Dockerfile for env vars, health endpoints, and dependencies.

Files to update (in order):

1. `roles/dcm_deploy/templates/dcm-<service>.container.j2` — create from an existing template of the same type
2. `roles/dcm_deploy/defaults/main.yml` — add image version variable
3. `roles/dcm_deploy/tasks/deploy_quadlet_files.yml` — TWO places: add to the `dcm_expected_quadlets` set_fact (used for stale file detection) AND to the core deploy loop (or as a conditional block with provider validation for optional providers). These lists overlap but serve different purposes — `dcm_expected_quadlets` includes all enabled services, the deploy loop only includes unconditional core services
4. `roles/dcm_deploy/tasks/start_services.yml` — add to startup sequence and running-state verification loop
5. `roles/dcm_deploy/tasks/validate_deployment.yml` — add to container assertions (and health check if it has one)
6. `roles/dcm_deploy/tasks/initialize_database.yml` — add database name if the service needs one. Core manager DBs go in the unconditional loop; optional provider DBs get their own conditional check/create tasks gated by `dcm_provider_*`
7. `roles/dcm_deploy/templates/dcm-gateway.container.j2` — if it's a core manager routed through Traefik, add to `After=`/`Requires=`
8. `verify_compose_alignment.yml` — add to `expected_core_services` or `expected_optional_services`, `service_to_template` mapping, and `infra_image_mapping` if it's an infrastructure image (not a DCM manager)
9. `molecule/default/verify.yml` — add to the appropriate container list (`core_containers` or `provider_containers`) and any relevant assertion groups (`manager_containers`, `env_file_containers`)
10. `README.md` — update stack components table and variable reference

### Existing service changed (env vars, dependencies, ports)

Run `ansible-playbook verify_compose_alignment.yml` — it will catch most drift automatically. Then manually check anything the playbook can't verify:

- Check `DB_NAME=` matches the database name in `initialize_database.yml`
- Update health endpoints in `validate_deployment.yml` if API paths changed
- If you add env vars to `alignment_allowlist` in `verify_compose_alignment.yml`, document why the divergence is intentional

### Image version bumps

Only update `defaults/main.yml` if compose pins a new major/minor (e.g., `postgres:16→17`, `traefik:v3.4→v3.5`). Manager versions default to `main` — don't change unless compose pins a specific tag.

### Config file changes (traefik.yml, routes.yml, init SQL)

These are copied at deploy time from the cloned repo — usually no action needed here. But if new config files are added upstream (e.g., additional Traefik middleware), update `tasks/generate_configs.yml` to copy them.

## CI

GitHub Actions runs six jobs on every PR targeting `main`:

- **check-clean-commits** — shared workflow that checks for merge commits, fixup/squash/WIP markers, vague commit messages
- **Lint** — `yamllint` + `ansible-lint`
- **Syntax check** — `ansible-playbook --syntax-check` on all playbooks
- **Compose-to-quadlet alignment** — runs `verify_compose_alignment.yml` against live upstream compose.yaml
- **Quadlet template rendering** — `molecule test` renders all core quadlet templates locally and asserts naming conventions, dependency symmetry, SELinux suffixes, Pull policy, env file references, and network membership
- **Quadlet template rendering (rootless)** — `molecule test -s rootless` renders templates with `dcm_rootless: true` and asserts rootless-specific paths, `WantedBy=default.target`, and systemd scope

### Molecule scenario

The `molecule/default/` scenario uses a delegated driver (no containers) and only runs `deploy_quadlet_files` with `ANSIBLE_SKIP_TAGS: systemd` to avoid systemd calls. It tests template rendering correctness, not deployment. Assertions are in `molecule/default/verify.yml`. When adding a new service, update the container lists and assertion groups there.

The `molecule/rootless/` scenario is identical in structure but sets `dcm_rootless: true` in its converge variables. It verifies that templates render with user-scoped paths and `WantedBy=default.target`. File ownership is not asserted because the delegated driver runs as the test user, not a real `dcm` service account. Assertions are in `molecule/rootless/verify.yml`.

### Task tags

Each phase in `tasks/main.yml` is tagged (`prerequisites`, `generate_configs`, `deploy_quadlet_files`, `initialize_database`, `start_services`, `validate_deployment`). The two `systemd_service` tasks in `deploy_quadlet_files.yml` are tagged `systemd` — this is how Molecule skips them in CI.
